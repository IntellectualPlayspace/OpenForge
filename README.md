# OpenForge Project

## Inspiration

OpenForge is a hackerspace in Famagusta that serves as a community-driven space for collaboration, creativity, and learning. The structure is heavily inspired by Noisebridge in San Francisco, and OpenForge strives to expand the philosophy and values of it.

What started this project: https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge

## Mission Statement

To provide a space for people to work on projects, learn new skills, and share knowledge without the need for formal classes or membership fees.

## OpenForgeâ€™s Philosophy

OpenForge is not anarchic in the sense of being lawless or chaotic, but it does embrace principles that align with anarchistic philosophies, particularly in terms of its organizational structure and decision-making processes.

### Decentralized Decision-Making
- OpenForge operates on a consensus-based decision-making model. Decisions are made collectively by the members, rather than by a centralized authority or leadership. This aligns with anarchistic ideals of decentralized power and direct democracy.

### Radical Inclusivity
- The hackerspace practices "Radical Inclusivity," welcoming everyone regardless of background, experience, or financial status. This approach reflects a commitment to equality and open access, which are values often associated with anarchistic principles.

### Self-Organization
- Members are encouraged to take initiative and organize events, projects, and improvements independently. This self-organizing model supports the idea of individuals and groups working autonomously while contributing to the community.

### Do-Ocracy
- OpenForge follows a "Do-Ocracy" principle, where individuals who are motivated and willing to take action have the freedom to do so. This concept emphasizes personal responsibility and initiative, rather than relying on formal positions of authority.

### Non-Hierarchical Structure
- The space has a flat organizational structure, with no formal hierarchy or executive roles. Members contribute to the community based on their interests and skills, without a top-down leadership approach.

### Community-Driven Maintenance
- The maintenance and organization of the space are managed collectively by the community, rather than by paid staff or a central authority. This collective responsibility is a key feature of self-managed spaces.

### True Freedom

OpenForge operates on a model that prioritizes community autonomy and a non-commercial atmosphere, so it does not function as a "billboard" for companies. The space is intentionally designed to be free of corporate influence, and it relies on donations from individuals and occasional grants rather than commercial sponsorships. This approach aligns with OpenForge's principles of radical inclusivity, do-ocracy, and mutual respect, ensuring that the space remains open and accessible to everyone, without the pressure or influence of corporate advertising.

## Key Features

### Open Access
- Operates on the principle of "Radical Inclusivity," meaning anyone can access the space without membership fees.
- The space is generally open to the public 24/7, fostering a welcoming environment for all.

### Diverse Community
- Includes a wide range of people: artists, engineers, programmers, students, and hobbyists.
- Collaboration and knowledge sharing are strongly encouraged.

### Tools and Equipment
- Equipped with various tools and resources including 3D printers, laser cutters, sewing machines, electronics workbenches, and a library of books.
- Tools are available for use by anyone, fostering a hands-on learning environment.

### Workshops and Events
- Hosts regular workshops, classes, and events on topics like coding, electronics, art, and more.
- Events are often free or donation-based, further promoting accessibility.

### Self-Organizing
- Operates on a consensus-based decision-making process. Major decisions are made through community agreement rather than top-down leadership.
- Members can propose and vote on new initiatives, policies, and the use of space and resources.

### Sustainability
- Funding primarily comes from donations, fundraising events, and occasional grants.
- The space is maintained and cleaned by the community, emphasizing collective responsibility.

## Culture and Philosophy

### Do-ocracy
A core principle of OpenForge is "do-ocracy," where members take initiative and responsibility for projects and tasks they are passionate about.

### Excellence
OpenForge encourages members to "Be excellent to each other," fostering a respectful and supportive environment.

### Transparency
Meetings and discussions are open, and financial records are transparent to the community.

## Challenges

### Sustainability
Maintaining a free and open space relies heavily on donations and volunteer efforts, which can be challenging to sustain.

### Space Management
Ensuring the space is organized and equipment is maintained requires continuous community effort.

### Inclusivity
Balancing openness with the need for a safe and respectful environment can be complex. This includes codes of conduct, safety training for equipment use, and procedures for handling conflicts.

## Impact

- OpenForge aims to inspire individuals, like many similar spaces around the world, by demonstrating the power of community-driven learning and collaboration.
- To become a launchpad for numerous projects, startups, and personal development stories, contributing significantly to the local and global maker movement.
