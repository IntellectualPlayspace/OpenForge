# OpenForge Project

## Inspiration

OpenForge is a hackerspace in Famagusta that serves as a community-driven space for collaboration, creativity, and learning. The structure is heavily inspired by Noisebridge in San Francisco, and OpenForge strives to expand the philosophy and values of it.

## Mission Statement

To provide a space for people to work on projects, learn new skills, and share knowledge without the need for formal classes or membership fees.

## Key Features

### Open Access
- Operates on the principle of "Radical Inclusivity," meaning anyone can access the space without membership fees.
- The space is generally open to the public 24/7, fostering a welcoming environment for all.

### Diverse Community
- Includes a wide range of people: artists, engineers, programmers, students, and hobbyists.
- Collaboration and knowledge sharing are strongly encouraged.

### Tools and Equipment
- Equipped with various tools and resources including 3D printers, laser cutters, sewing machines, electronics workbenches, and a library of books.
- Tools are available for use by anyone, fostering a hands-on learning environment.

### Workshops and Events
- Hosts regular workshops, classes, and events on topics like coding, electronics, art, and more.
- Events are often free or donation-based, further promoting accessibility.

### Self-Organizing
- Operates on a consensus-based decision-making process. Major decisions are made through community agreement rather than top-down leadership.
- Members can propose and vote on new initiatives, policies, and the use of space and resources.

### Sustainability

## Challenges

### Sustainability
Maintaining a free and open space relies heavily on donations and volunteer efforts, which can be challenging to sustain.

### Space Management
Ensuring the space is organized and equipment is maintained requires continuous community effort.

### Inclusivity
Balancing openness with the need for a safe and respectful environment can be complex.
